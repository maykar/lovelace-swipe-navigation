# Config:

Mark Watt does an excellent job covering configuation [in this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03IPN9lBEfE&t=663s).

* Configuration is done in the root of your lovelace configuration.
* If you just want to use the default config values you don't need to add a config at all.

**Config Options:**<br>

| Name | Type | Default | Description
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -----------
| swipe_amount | number | 15 | Minimum percent of screen needed to be swiped in order to navigate.
| skip_tabs | string | | A comma seperated list of views to skip when swiping. e.g., `1,3,5`.
| skip_hidden | boolean | true | Automatically skips hidden tabs.
| wrap | boolean | true | Wrap from first tab to last tab and vice versa.
| prevent_default | boolean | false | Prevents the browsers default horizontal swipe actions. May require a browser refresh to take effect, if using an HA companion app this can be done by closing the app and reopening.
| animate | string |  | Swipe animations. Can be: `swipe`, `fade`, `flip`. The swipe animation should be considered experimental and depending on your setup may appear buggy.

**Example:**<br>
Don't just copy the example, it won't fit your needs. Build your own using the config options above.
```yaml
swipe_nav:
  wrap: false
  animate: swipe
  skip_tabs: 5,6,7,8
  prevent_default: true
  swipe_amount: 30
  
views:
```
